# Resume Screening App

An NLP and machine learning–based application that automatically analyzes and classifies resumes to streamline the recruitment process.

---

## Overview

Manual resume screening is time-consuming and prone to human bias. This project automates the resume evaluation process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify resumes into relevant job categories.

The system processes resume text, extracts meaningful features using TF-IDF, and applies a trained machine learning model to generate accurate predictions through a simple application interface.
