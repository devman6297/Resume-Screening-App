## Project Description

The Resume Screening App is a machine learning–based application designed to automate the process of resume evaluation. Instead of manually reviewing resumes, the system analyzes resume text and classifies candidates based on relevant job categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The project uses text preprocessing and feature extraction methods such as TF-IDF, followed by a machine learning classifier to accurately screen resumes. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and real-time prediction through an application interface.

This application helps improve efficiency, reduce human bias, and speed up the recruitment process by providing intelligent resume screening using Python and machine learning.
